keepass 2.x handmade mirror because I can't find any live repo


The original developer of Keepass [doesn't](http://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/b0bb5457/?limit=50#cc80) 
seem to be hot on the idea of a [public repository](http://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/02383c83/?limit=50#22a9), 
so users have made handmade ones from the sourcecode released on Sourceforge! This is a fork from one such fork. 

Hope this invites a broader userbase to contribute to the project more easily, please feel free to send in pull requests.
